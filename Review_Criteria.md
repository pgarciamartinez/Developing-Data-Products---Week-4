## Your Shiny Application

- Was there enough documentation on the shiny site for a user to get started using the application?
- Did the application run as described in the documentation?
- Was there some form of widget input (slider, textbox, radio buttons, checkbox, ...) in either ui.R or a custom web page?
- Did server.R perform some calculations on the input in server.R?
- Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?
- Was the app substantively different than the very simple applications built in the class? Note, it's OK if the app is simple and based on the one presented in class. I just don't want it to be basically a carbon copy of the examples we covered. For example, if someone simply changed the variable names, then this would not count. However, a prediction algorithm that had a similar layout would be fine.
- Here's your opportunity to give the app +1 for being well done, or neat, or even just a solid effort.

## Your Reproducible Pitch

- Was the presentation completed in slidify or R Presenter?
- Was it 5 pages?
- Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?
- Did it contain an R expression that got evaluated and displayed?
- Was it hosted on github or Rpubs?
- Was the server calculation displayed in the html page?
- Here's your opportunity to give this presentation a +1 for being well done. Did they tinker around with the default style? Was the presentation particularly lucid and well organized? In other words, the student made a legitimate try.
- There were no R errors displayed in the presentation.
